# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


In this task, i am using react + vite with Tailwind css and tailwind-scrollbar-hide, react-hook-form

For tailwind-scrollbar-hide you have to install by using - npm install tailwind-scrollbar-hide

For react-hook-form, you have to install by using - npm install react-hook-form

Command to run the project -
npm install
npm run dev
